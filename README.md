# To-Do-List-using-ruby
A simple example of a web application using HTML for the front end, CSS for styling, and Ruby for the backend.

/myapp
  ├── views
  |   └── index.erb
  ├── public
  |   └── style.css
  └── app.rb
  
Step 1: Create app.rb (Ruby Backend):

Step 2: Create views/index.erb (HTML Frontend):

Step 3: Create public/style.css (CSS for styling):

Step 4: Install Sinatra (if not already installed):
gem install sinatra

Step 5: Run the Application:
ruby app.rb

This is a basic example, and you can extend it further by adding a database for persistence, user authentication, and more features based on your requirements.
